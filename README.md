### 👋 What is closedNote?

closedNote is a simple web app for **saving, organizing, and re-using your best prompts**, built for *students, teachers, engineers, prompt engineers, prompt tutors, and even regular folks like my mum 😅.*

It's the one place you can finally dump all your fire prompts without digging through old chats or screenshots.
A calm home for all your creativity.

### 💡 The Story

I got tired of re-engineering my "perfect ChatGPT prompts" every time I needed a particular kind of answer.
Then my mum started doing the same thing (don't ask how she got into it 😭).
Then my grandma.
Then my classmates.

Meanwhile, prompt engineers were dropping crazy tips on X (Twitter) and Stack Overflow, but I had nowhere to store them neatly.

So, I built one.
That's what **closedNote** is all about, a small home to make **prompt saving easier for everyone**. 🙂🙂

Completely open source, open to contributions, and continuously improving.

### 🗄️ Database Setup (Supabase + PostgreSQL)

closedNote runs on **Supabase**, which provides both authentication and secure cloud storage using **Row Level Security (RLS)**, meaning no one can see your notes but you.

### 🖼️ Image to Text (OCR)

closedNote lets you turn screenshots, photos, and handwritten notes into prompts without retyping everything.

**How it works:**

1. You upload an image (screenshot, photo of notes, whatever)
2. The app tries to send it to **Hugging Face OCR API** (our planned primary engine)
3. If that fails or isn't set up yet, it falls back to **Tesseract.js** running right in your browser
4. The extracted text shows up, you can edit it if needed
5. One click saves it as a prompt in your library

![OCR Feature](./screenshots/OCR.png)

**Current Status:**

Right now, Tesseract is the stable workhorse while we finalize the Hugging Face integration (API hiccups, you know how it goes). The code is structured so swapping between both or combining them later is super easy.

**Why This Matters:**

Ever find yourself screenshotting a great prompt from Twitter or a Discord server, then having to manually retype the whole thing? Yeah, me too. That's done now.

**The Details:**

When you upload an image:
* **Online Mode**: Sends to Hugging Face TrOCR (Microsoft's printed/handwritten models)
* **Offline Mode**: Falls back to Tesseract.js (runs locally, no internet needed)
* **AI Refinement**: After extraction, you can clean up the text with Zephyr or Mixtral chat models
* **Auto-Save**: Tagged with "ocr" so you can find all your screenshot-based prompts later

**What's Cool:**

The architecture is built with a **primary + fallback** mindset. Even if Hugging Face is down, you're not blocked. Even if you're offline on a train, Tesseract still works. No single point of failure.

### 🧪 How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aboderinsamuel/closedNote.git
cd closedNote
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Supabase keys inside .env.local
# (Optional) Add HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY for online OCR
npm run dev
```

Then visit 👉 **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

**OCR Setup (Optional):**
- Get a free Hugging Face token from [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
- Add `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_yourtoken` to `.env.local`
- That's it! OCR will automatically use Hugging Face when available, or fall back to Tesseract
