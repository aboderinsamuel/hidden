# 🗺️ Where closedNote is Going

> The plan for the future (but it's flexible, we'll see where the community takes us)

## 🎯 The Big Picture

Make closedNote the **go-to place for saving and organizing AI prompts**, whether you're a student cramming for exams, my mum trying to remember her favorite ChatGPT prompts, or a prompt engineer building the next big thing.

Simple, reliable, and useful for **everyone**.

---

## 📍 Where We Are Now (v0.1)

✅ **What's Working**
- Sign up and log in (Supabase handles this)
- Create, edit, and delete prompts
- Organize with tags and collections
- Search and filter your prompts
- Works on mobile and desktop
- Dark mode (because light mode hurts at night)
- Global search (Ctrl/Cmd+K)
- Copy prompts with one click

It's basic, but it works. And that's the whole point.

## 📝 Real Talk

This roadmap is a **rough plan**, not a promise. Timelines might slip, features might change, some things might never happen. I'm building this between classes at UNILAG, so it moves as fast as I can make it move.

But the goal stays the same: **make prompt saving easier for everyone**.

If that resonates with you, stick around. 🚀

**Current Status**: v0.1 (early days!)  
**Last Updated**: November 2025  
**Next Big Thing**: Getting Phase 1 features shipped
