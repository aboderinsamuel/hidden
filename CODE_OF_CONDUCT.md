# Code of Conduct

> How we treat each other in the closedNote community

---

## The Deal

closedNote is a project I started because I was tired of losing my prompts, and now it's growing into something bigger. Whether you're a student like me, a teacher, my mum (yes, she's in here somewhere 😅), or a prompt engineer dropping wisdom from X, **everyone's welcome here**.

But to keep this space helpful and drama-free, here's what we expect from each other:

---

## ✅ What We're About

**Be cool to people.**  
That's it, really. But let me break it down:

- **Respect everyone's ideas** - Your "perfect prompt" might look different from mine, and that's fine
- **Help newcomers** - We all started somewhere (I literally started this 'cause I kept losing my prompts 😭)
- **Give feedback kindly** - "This could be better if..." not "This is trash"
- **Own your mistakes** - You broke something? Cool, fix it. We've all been there
- **Keep it productive** - We're here to build something useful, not argue about random stuff

---

## ❌ What We Don't Do

Don't be that person who:

- **Disrespects people** - No insults, harassment, or making anyone feel unwelcome
- **Spams or trolls** - This isn't Twitter beef territory
- **Shares private info** - Don't post someone's email, phone, or personal details without permission
- **Acts like they own the place** - I built this, but it's a community project now. Ego stays at the door
- **Discriminates** - Your age, background, experience level, location (🇳🇬 or anywhere else) - none of that matters here

---

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

Look, I'm just a Computer Engineering student trying to build something cool. If someone's making the community toxic or uncomfortable:

**Email me directly: [aboderinseun01@gmail.com](mailto:aboderinseun01@gmail.com)**

I'll:
1. Read what happened
2. Talk to the people involved
3. Figure out what's fair (warning, timeout, or in extreme cases, a ban)
4. Keep your report private

I'm not running a corporate HR department here, I'm just trying to keep closedNote a good place for everyone.

## 🙏🏽 The Spirit of It

I didn't build closedNote to gatekeep or create some exclusive club. I built it because **my mum, my grandma, my classmates, and I** all needed a simple way to save prompts.

So whether you're contributing code, suggesting features, reporting bugs, or just using the app, **let's keep it helpful, humble, and human**.

If you can vibe with that, you're already following the Code of Conduct. 🚀

---

**Bottom line:** Be respectful, be helpful, don't be a jerk. Simple as that.
